* [Learning Position and Target Consistency for Memory-based Video Object Segmentation
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04329): Matching-based methods do not consider any prior about the sequential order of the frames and how pixels of an object move together.
This paper addresses this problem by introducing 1) global retrieval module, 2) position guidance module, 3) object relation module.
